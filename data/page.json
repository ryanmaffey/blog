As a back-end developer for the first six months I created a social media management extension for the _Umbraco_ content management system.\n\nAs a front-end developer for the final six months I was given a range of smaller projects, but the one I enjoyed the most was creating a JavaScript library to create one or more geo-fences and tell you whether you were inside or outside of any geo-fenced areas using the browser's _Geolocation API_.\n\n### Redweb (2015 - 2017)\n\n<p class=\"text-gray-500\">Front-End Developer</p>\n\nAnd so I was back! I was mostly responsible for creating the visual components, forms, search pages, etc. for large sites built on top of _Sitecore_ (another content management system).\n\nDuring my time here I was able to really progress my CSS & JS skills. I learned about _Gulp_ and _Sass_, I removed my reliance on _jQuery_ and continued to learn Angular v1.\n\nRedweb was a brilliant start to my career, but after couple of years I felt as though it was time to move on. I knew I had more to offer but there wasn't the scope for me to grow like I wanted to. I have very fond memories of my time there and I learned a lot from the job and the people.\n\n### Amigo Loans (2017 - Present)\n\n<p class=\"text-gray-500\">Front-End Software Engineer</p>\n\nI have massively grown as a developer as a result of working at Amigo. Despite my job title I have essentially become a full-stack developer. I've learned a lot about building _.NET_ / _.NET Core MVC_ applications and services, and building front-ends using _React_, _Redux_, _Webpack_, _TypeScript_ and more. All of this knowledge has completely transformed my ability and confidence as a developer.\n\nI also look after all of the Engineering placement students when they first join the team. I help them get set up, settled in and generally be there whenever they have any questions, technical or otherwise.\n\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"mt-16\">\n\n## Education\n\nI'm very proud to have been awarded a First Class Honours Degree in Web Development and Design _Loughborough University_. My stand-out achievement throughout my time at University is definitely my Final Year Project, which was inspired by my experiences during my placement year.\n\n### Final Year Project\n\nThe Front-End Developers at Redweb faced the same problem frequently; test devices kept going missing! The solution: create a system to allow people to check the devices in and out so that we can see who has which device.\n\nI used _Angular v1_ to power the web application and _Socket.io_ to keep everything in sync in real-time. I was inspired by some people at Redweb to incorporate a hardware element to my project. I'd seen some of the things that they'd managed to build using an _Arduino_ and it was awesome. I knew if I could include something like that into my project it could really help set it apart from the rest.\n\nThe idea was that each device sits on its own dedicated stand, onto which I could attach a photoresistor (light sensor). I know whether a device is on it's stand or not by how much light is reaching the sensor (light = device checked-out, dark = device checked-in). When someone picks up a device and swipes their staff card on the RFID reader it registers the individual as checking-out the device. Equally, when the the device is returned, the system would register the device as checked-in. Whenever the state of any of the devices changed, the web application would be instantly updated. Pretty neat!\n\nIt was a lot of hard work building an application like that using tech I was really unfamiliar with. Nevertheless, I managed to get working a proof of concept to show to my lecturers on presentation day. Fortunately the demo went really smoothly and the lecturers absolutely loved it."}]
