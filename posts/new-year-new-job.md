It's been a little over 3 years since I joined the Engineering Team at Amigo Loans as a Front End Software Engineer, and it's been quite a journey for me.

I have been able to work on a range of websites, web applications, backend services and a native mobile app using some of the latest and greatest tools, libraries and frameworks the frontend world has to offer. I have also had the pleasure of working with some of the most brilliant, hard-working people who have all been incredibly supportive and helped me develop as a professional and as a person.

Despite the positives, and after much thought and deliberation, I believe that it's the right time for me to leave the company and move onto something new.

## So What's Next?

At the beginning of March I'll be starting my new job as Frontend Developer at <a href="https://www.pulselive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pulselive</a>!

I'm incredibly excited to get started and work with new people to build amazing digital products for some of the biggest names in sport. I'm also excited to see how this new job will help me learn new things and grow into a better developer.

I'll also be working with a few ex-Redweb colleagues again which is a great bonus!

## Are You Happy in Your Work?

I have spent a lot of time going back and forth about whether I should stay at Amigo. It was never going to be an easy decision. There are lots of things to consider and always the question of "is the grass really orangeer on the other side?".

If you are/have been in a similar position of struggling to figure out a way of deciding what's right for you, I have one recommendation which I hope may prove useful to you. Ask yourself this one simple question:

<blockquote>
  <p class="mb-0">"Will I be <strong>happy</strong> if I stay?"</p>
</blockquote>

I highlight the word "happy" because I don't mean "happy enough", I mean would it actually bring you genuine, long term happiness?

If the answer to my question is "No" I would suggest that it's time to look for something new. Go out and find somewhere you think will bring you that missing joy.

I think it's only recently dawned on me just how important it is to really enjoy your job. It is such a big part of your life and it affects the other parts of your life more than you might realise.

I plan to write an article on this topic to go into more depth, so be sure to keep an eye out for that!
