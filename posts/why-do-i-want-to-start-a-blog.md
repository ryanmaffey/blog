It makes sense to kick off this blog by explaining why I want to start a blog at all!

I spend quite a lot of time reading articles that I think might be interesting and/or useful for my career; it's part of how many of us keep up to date with everything that's happening in the industry. Reading content written by other developers makes me feel proud and grateful that there are a large number of people who are open and happy to share their knowledge and experiences so freely. It has inspired me to start doing the same.

## I'm Doing This for You

### Offering Help & Support

I cannot tell you the amount of times I’ve been saved by someone’s blog post. I think we've all been there, frantically searching the web for an answer to the issue we're having and eventually you stumble across a stranger's article that completely saved the day.

It’s my hope that I might be able to be the one providing that kind of support and relief to someone else for a change. Through this blog I have the opportunity to give back to the world-wide community of developers which has already done so much for me.

### Sharing Insight and Experience

This is particularly applicable if you are a developer who is early on in their career or a student working your way towards a certification in software development. I got my first job as a developer back in 2015 and I've learned a heck of a lot over those five years which I'd love to be able to share with the world. I hope that you can use some of the knowledge that I have to share to help you learn and grow in your own career.

### Creating Enjoyment and Interest

I really want you to enjoy reading my work, there would be little point in creating content if I didn't think people might enjoy reading it. The best way I can help make that happen is to work hard to ensure that the content I'm creating is useful and interesting.

## I'm Doing This for Me

As much as all the above is completely true, I can’t pretend like there aren’t a few benefits for me too!

### Learning and Growth

I'm a strong believer that a great way to learn something is to try to teach it. Having the ability to teach a subject requires you to understand it well enough to be able to communicate the details effectively to a learner. It's a technique which I intend on taking advantage of in order to help me grow my own knowledge and experience.

### Communication

Good written and verbal communication are skills that I somewhat pride myself on. It takes consideration and practice to be an effective communicator and this platform will provide me with plenty of writing practice. It's going to be important that I write clearly and concisely whilst also maintaining people's interest and engagement.

## Final Words

I really hope this blog lives up to all of my hopes and expectations. It’s going to take time and effort to build but I’m excited to get creating and seeing how it all turns out!
