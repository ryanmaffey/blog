It makes sense to kick off this blog by explaining why I want to start a blog at all!

I try to read any and all content I come across which I think I’ll find interesting, enlightening and useful. The content can be on larger, well-known blogs/sites or it can be content on platforms like DEV. Either way reading content written by other people in my industry makes me feel very grateful that so many people are so open and happy to share their knowledge and experiences so freely, and it inspires me to do the same.

## For you

### Support

I cannot tell you the amount of times I’ve been saved by a blog post someone’s written which helps me solve a problem I’m having. Or takes me through a complicated process in a way which makes it really easy to follow and understand which saves me time and frustration, and saves me giving up altogether. It’s my hope that I might be able to be the one providing that kind of support and relief to someone else for a change, giving back to the word-wide community of developers which has already done the same for me.

### Enjoyment

Even if I read an article on a technology that I’m never going to use, or it could be an explanation of how someone solved a problem I’m likely never to face. I find it intriguing to see what people have to say and enjoy... That’s what I want for my readers; enjoyment!

## For me

As much as all the above is 100% true, I can’t pretend like there aren’t a few more selfish motives too!

### Learning and Growth

A great way to try and learn something is to try to teach it to someone else. Even if it’s something you think you already know it can help you realise and fill holes in your knowledge. By extension, build confidence.

### Communication

A skill I somewhat pride myself for being good at. Takes consideration and practice and this platform is definitely going to provide me with the ability to think carefully about how I communicate with readers and get my points across clearly and keep things engaging.

## Final words

I hope this blog manages to achieve all of the things I’ve talked about in this article. It’s going to take time and effort to build but I’m really excited to get writing and seeing how it all turns out!
