Following on from <a href="/post/brave-brilliant-browser-and-the-future-of-online-advertising">my previous post about the Brave web browser</a>, I've now become a Brave Verified Creator!

## What Does This Mean?

If you use the <a href="https://brave.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Brave</a> browser and are opted-in to Brave Rewards and Auto-Contributions it means I'll get a small portion of the <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Basic Attention Tokens (BAT)</a> you receive for viewing ads.

As I talked about in my previous post, it's a brilliant mechanism to allow creators like me to monetize their content really easily without forcing visitors to see horrible, intrusive on-page advertisements. If you're interested in supporting small content creators like me without it costing you a penny, you should definitely give Brave a try!

## What Am I Going to Do with All My New Found Riches?

The reality is that I don't stand to earn very much, if anything at all with the small number of visitors I bring to this site. But on the off chance I earn a few pennies it'll go towards covering the cost of renewing my domain purchase, so it makes keeping this website going that little bit cheaper for me.

## Content Creator? Consider Signing Up!

If you want to take advantage of Brave Rewards, you can do so completely free of charge! Here's an overview of what you need to do:

1. <a href="https://brave.com/download/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Download Brave</a>
1. Set Up Brave Rewards
    - Brave will guide you through this process
    - You can make changes via Brave's settings at any time
1. <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034841711-What-is-a-verified-wallet-" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Connect and verify your Brave Wallet</a> with <a href="https://uphold.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Uphold</a>
    - The wallet gets created alongside the Brave Rewards setup
1. <a href="https://creators.brave.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sign up as a Brave Creator</a>
1. <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021408352" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Verify ownership of your content</a>
    - If, like me, you use the "File Upload Verification" method, you can remove the file from the _.well-known/_ folder once you've completed verification
    - You have to wait up to 24 hours for the verification to take effect

I would say the whole process can be done in about 15-20 mins...though that's a bit of a guess because I've not done a straight run-through before.

And that's it! You can continue to create the content you and your readers/viewers love and check back every now and then to see how much BAT you're earning by logging into your <a href="https://creators.brave.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Brave Rewards Creators</a> account.
